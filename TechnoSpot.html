                        <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

                            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>

                        <p>Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures. Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.</p>
